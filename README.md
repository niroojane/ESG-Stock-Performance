# ESG-Stock-Performance
The goal of this project is to compare high ESG stocks outperforms low ESG stocks of the S&amp;P500. In order to do this first i used the efficient frontier and created random portfolios and analysed if in risk/rewards terms one category is better than the other.
In the second part i constructed a portfolio through stock picking that could have a good ESG score in average and tried to outperform a benchmark.
